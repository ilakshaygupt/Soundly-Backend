## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Ensure that you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website.

### Installing Dependencies

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

    - **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

2. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install all the required packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the Django Project

1. Apply database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    The Django development server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided address to view the Django project.
